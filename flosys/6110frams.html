Hi all,<br>
<p>
sorry for bothering again with 6110 stuff, but I have observed some more<br>
things about protocol and I do not want you to duplicate this work. I'd be<br>
glad if someone (probably Richard?) can collect information about protocol<br>
(from Richard's page, from Colin's mail and from this group).<br>
</p><p>
BTW - sorry for my english ;-)<br>

Frames of type 0x08 (PIN code)<br>
</p><p>
This type of the frame is used to enter PIN (Personal Identification Number=<br>
).<br>
</p><p>
=091e 00 0c 08 00 0d 00 01 00 0a 02 "abcd" 00 00 01 41 00 xx yy<br>
</p><p>
"abcd" is the PIN. For example if your PIN is 1234 so "abcd" is 31 32 33<br>
34. "xx yy" is the checksum.<br>
</p><p>
The above frame is send to mobile phone and it responds with an acknowledge<br>
frame:<br>
</p><p>
=091e 0c 00 7f 00 02 08 01 16 70<br>
</p><p>
And one of the next frame from the phone is one of these:<br>
</p><p>
1. When the SIM card is not inserted, the phone displays "Insert SIM card" =<br>
and<br>
sends:<br>
</p><p>
=091e 0c 00 08 00 07 01 08 00 0c 6f 01 41 00 31 06<br>
</p><p>
2. When we are sending the PIN code when the phone has the message "Enter P=<br>
IN<br>
code:" on its display:<br>
</p><p>
=091e 0c 00 08 00 06 01 08 00 0b 01 41 1e 40<br>
</p><p>
This means that the entered PIN was correct - the phone displays the messag=<br>
e<br>
"Code accepted".<br>
</p><p>
3. When the PIN is incorrect or already entered, the phone responds with<br>
</p><p>
=091e 0c 00 08 00 07 01 08 00 0c 88 01 41 00 d6 06<br>
</p><p>
and it displays "Code error!" when the PIN is incorrect and the correct one=<br>
 is<br>
not already entered.<br>
</p><p>
This is somewhat different than Colin already reported. When the PIN is OK,<br>
the respond message has length 0x06. Colin reported 0x07. Another differenc=<br>
e<br>
is when correct PIN frame is send when PIN is already entered. Colin said t=<br>
hat<br>
the respond frame is the same as if we send correct PIN. My tests showed th=<br>
at<br>
it is not. Weird. Can you tell us something about it?<br>
</p><p>

<p>
Frames of type 0x09 (registering with the network)
</p><p>
When the PIN frame is sent the phone also sends this frame.
</p><p>
=091e 0c 00 09 00 06 01 08 00 80 01 42 1e c9
</p><p>
Colin Paton things that this means "registered OK with the network".
</p><p>
The meaning of this frame is not known. I have observed this frame also whe=
n
the phone is powered off:
</p><p>
=091e 0c 00 09 00 06 01 08 00 81 01 46 1e cc
</p><p>
The only different byte is 0x81 (changed from 0x80) so this frame should me=
an
"unregistered from the network".
