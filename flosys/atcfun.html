Hi,
<br>
Had anyone noticed that the "AT+CFUN=0", once processed through NCDS, is
<br>
actually simulating keyboard input?
<br>
I was capturing dumps and trying to implement a "power-off" function...
<br>
Using a normal terminal I was issuing "AT+CFUN=0".  Didn't think too much
<br>
about it when it wasn't working and the message to unlock the keyboard
<br>
appeared on my phone.  Once unlocked, it worked fine.
<br>
Each time, NCDS sends these two frames:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1E 00 0C 0C 00 08 00 01 00 42 01 0D 01 42 12 08
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1E 00 0C 0C 00 08 00 01 00 42 02 0D 01 40 11 0A
<br>
</p><p>When I tried implementing in gnokii (I'm only half-way there), I realized
<br>
the the first frame appears to be the same as pressing the power button,
<br>
and the second pressing the 'Ok' button.
<br>
</p><p>Has anyone seen this behaviour also?
<br>
</p><p>(Hmmm... I seeing a function in a full-featured gnokii which would
<br>
automatically change the current profile at a given time... :-)  )
<br>
